Introduction: In today's fast-paced financial markets, staying informed about market sentiment is crucial for investors, traders, and financial analysts. Market sentiment, often influenced by financial news, plays a significant role in shaping investor decisions, market predictions, risk management strategies, and understanding market psychology. The project focused on extracting, analyzing, and correlating financial news sentiment with stock market trends, with a particular emphasis on news related to NVIDIA Corporation.

Motivation: My enthusiasm for trading and the stock market has always propelled me towards projects that allow me to integrate my learning with my interests. By analyzing financial news sentiment, I sought to gain insights into its influence on investor decisions, market predictions, and risk management strategies. This project serves as a platform to connect theoretical knowledge with practical applications, fostering a deeper understanding of market psychology and dynamics.

Problem Statement: The core objective of this project revolves around analyzing financial news sentiment and its correlation with stock market trends, particularly focusing on NVIDIA Corporation. By delving into this analysis, I aimed to address fundamental questions:

-How does sentiment in financial news articles impact market sentiment and investor behavior? -What is the relationship between news sentiment and stock prices, particularly adjusted closing prices? -Can sentiment analysis of financial news articles provide predictive insights into market movements and trends?

Methodology: Data Collection: I scraped financial news articles related to NVIDIA Corporation from Investing.com, overcoming challenges such as website security measures and changes in website structures. Text Preprocessing: The scraped news articles underwent preprocessing, including tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization, to prepare them for sentiment analysis. Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing the VADER sentiment analysis tool, I analyzed the sentiment of news articles, obtaining polarity scores for positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. Correlation Analysis: Correlation matrices were computed to investigate the relationship between news sentiment and stock market data, focusing on adjusted closing prices and trading volume. Visualization: I visualized the correlations and trends between news sentiment and stock market data through heatmaps and line plots, facilitating the interpretation of analysis results.
